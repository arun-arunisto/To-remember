# DRF-with-celery-redis-flower

This commands are used to activate celery, redis, and flower on django, djangorestframework, first always activate your `env` file, then run your project using the below command

```CommandPrompt
python manage.py runserver
```

To run the celery worker open new terminal with current environment activate and on the same directory, and run the below command

```CommandPrompt
celery -A <your_project_name> worker -l info
```

To run the celery beat open new terminal on the same directory with environment activate, and run the below command

```CommandPrompt
celery -A <your_project_name> beat -l info
```

Then start the `redis-server` on new terminal with environment activate on the same directory, for that run the below command

> [!NOTE]
> I am using ubuntu 24.04 and used snap for installing redis and redisinsight
> If you're using MacOS, windows, or other linux distro please read the documentation on redis website

for running the redis-server on my ubuntu machine

```CommandPrompt
redis-server --port 6380 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379 
```

The command will starts a new Redis instance using port 6380 as a replica of the instance running at 127.0.0.1 port 6379. After all this to monitor celery I'm using `Flower` so run the below command (terminal with `env` activate on the same directory) to open the `Flower` dashboard.

```CommandPrompt
celery -A <your_project_folder> flower --broker:redis://
```

Then navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5555/](http://127.0.0.1:5555/) for monitoring celery tasks using flower

> [!NOTE]
> use `celery -A <project_name> purge` to remove all tasks

> [!TIP]
> Here i'm redis as my `broker-agent` if your using anyother platform please read the documentation for flower

# How to use pip packages on intranet (a private network)

***STEP 1:***

First on a machine with internet access download the dependencies using `pip`

***syntax:***

```bash
pip download <package-name> -d <directory-path>
```

***Example:***

I want to download the `pandas` library inside the directory `packages-and-libraries`, the command will be like this:

```bash
pip download pandas -d packages-and-libraries/
```

The above command will download the `pandas` library inside the `packages-and-libraries` directory.

***STEP 2:***

Transfer the directory that contains download packages to the offline machine

> [!NOTE]
> Use any data transfer medium that doesn't require internet access and allowed by your organization

***STEP 3:***

Create and activate a virtual environment to install the packages and libraries

> [!NOTE]
> Using a virtual environment is not strictly necessary, but it is highly recommended when installing and running packages and libraries, especially in offline scenarios.

To create a virtual environment use the below command:

```bash
python -m venv <your-virtual-environment-name>
```

To `activate` virtual environment on ***windows***, use the below command:

```bash
<your-venv>\Scripts\activate
```

On ***Linux/macOS***

```bash
source <your-venv>/bin/activate
```

***STEP 4:***

Install the packages that you already downloaded using the below command:

***Syntax:***

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=<your-download-directory>/ <package-name>
```

***Example:***

On the above example we download the `pandas` library inside the `packages-and-libraries` directory. So, to install the `pandas` the command will be look like this:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=packages-and-libraries/ pandas
```

If you want to install the dependencies using `requirements.txt` file you can use the below command:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=<your-download-dir>/ -r requirements.txt
```

Migrations on django for different scenario

***First Scenario:*** To migrate all the contents of your project use:

```Python
Python manage.py makemigrations
```

After that,

```Python
python manage.py migrate
```

***Second Scenario:*** If you want to migrate only from a particular app use the below command

```Python
python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>
```

After that,

```Python
python manage.py migrate <app-name>
```
***Example:*** If i have an app named `blogs` and i want to migrate the models from that app.

```Python
python manage.py makemigrations blogs
```

After that same for `migrate` command also

```Python
python manage.py migrate blogs
```

***Third Scenario:*** If i want to migrate a particular migration file from a particular app

```Python
python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>
```

And if you make migrations it will create a python file on your `app`'s migrations directory, so you can use that filename to migrate, like below

```Python
python manage.py migrate <app-name> <file>
```
***Example:*** i have an app named `blogs` and i want to migrate a particular migrations file from the app, it will look like below

```Python
python manage.py makemigrations blogs
```
After makemigrations it will create files like `0001_initial.py` on your migrations folder on your app folder so you have to migrate using the file like below

```Python
python manage.py migrate blogs 0001
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're getting errors while using `migrate` command you can check the ***sqlqueries*** using `python manage.py sqlmigrate <app-name> <file>`

# Daemonising Django, Celery & Celery Beat

## Django

#### Step 1: Create a `systemd` Service File

Create a new service file for your Django project. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/django.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Django Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/django/project
ExecStart=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
          your_project_name.wsgi:application
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace the placeholders:
- `your_user` – Your system's username.
- `your_group` – Your system's group name (often the same as your username).
- `/path/to/your/django/project` – The full path to your Django project directory.
- `/path/to/your/virtualenv` – The full path to your virtual environment.
- `your_project_name` – The name of your Django project.

This example uses **Gunicorn** as the application server. Ensure Gunicorn is installed in your virtual environment if you're using it:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

#### Step 2: Reload `systemd` and Start the Service

Reload the `systemd` daemon and start your Django service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start django
```

To enable Django to start automatically when the system boots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable django
```

You can check the status of your Django service with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status django
```

#### Step 3: Allow Port 8000 (Optional)

If you're running your Django project on port 8000 and using a firewall like `ufw`, you may need to open the port:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8000
```

## Celery

#### Step 1: Create Celery Service File

Create a new `systemd` service file for Celery:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/celery.service
```

Add the following configuration to the file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Celery Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=your_user
Group=your_group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
ExecStartPre=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/celery -A your_project_name purge -f
ExecStart=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/celery -A your_project_name worker --loglevel=INFO
ExecStop=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/celery multi stop worker --pidfile=/path/to/pid/celery.pid
ExecReload=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/celery multi restart worker --pidfile=/path/to/pid/celery.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Replace the following placeholders:
- `your_user` – Your system username.
- `your_group` – Your system user group.
- `/path/to/your/project` – The path to your Django project.
- `/path/to/your/virtualenv` – The path to your virtual environment.
- `your_project_name` – The name of your Django project.

#### Step 2: Reload and Start the Service

Reload the `systemd` daemon and start the Celery service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start celery
```

To enable Celery to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable celery
```

You can check the status of the Celery service with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status celery
```

## Celery Beat

#### Step 1: Create a `systemd` Service File for Celery Beat

Create a new service file for Celery Beat:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/celerybeat.service
```

Add the following configuration:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Celery Beat Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/django/project
ExecStart=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/celery -A \
          your_project_name beat --loglevel=INFO \
          --pidfile=/var/run/celerybeat.pid
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace the placeholders:
- `your_user`: The system user that will run the service.
- `your_group`: The group of the system user.
- `/path/to/your/django/project`: The absolute path to your Django project.
- `/path/to/your/virtualenv`: The absolute path to your virtual environment.
- `your_project_name`: Your Django project name.

#### Step 2: Reload `systemd` and Start the Service

After creating the service file, reload `systemd` and start the Celery Beat service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start celerybeat
```

To ensure that Celery Beat starts on system boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable celerybeat
```

Check the status of the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status celerybeat
```

If this not working try this method

```bash
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:9001)
```

## 30.09.2024

To configure **Gunicorn** for serving your Django application in a production environment, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Gunicorn**

First, install Gunicorn in your Django project environment:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

You can add it to your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to ensure it gets installed whenever the project is set up.

### 2. **Running Gunicorn Locally (for testing)**

You can start Gunicorn to serve your Django project by running:

```bash
gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application
```

Here:
- `myproject` is the name of your Django project folder where the `wsgi.py` file is located.
- `application` refers to the WSGI application callable in `myproject/wsgi.py`.

This command starts a basic Gunicorn server that serves your Django app.

### 3. **Configuring Gunicorn with Options**

To properly configure Gunicorn for production, you'll need to pass some options. These include the number of worker processes, the host and port, and logging configurations.

A basic command with options might look like this:

```bash
gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi:application
```

- **`--workers 3`**: Specifies the number of worker processes (a good rule of thumb is 2x the number of CPU cores).
- **`--bind 0.0.0.0:8000`**: Specifies the host and port where Gunicorn will listen.
- **`myproject.wsgi:application`**: This points to the WSGI application in your Django project.

### 4. **Advanced Configuration with a Gunicorn Configuration File**

You can create a configuration file to store all your settings, which makes management easier. This file can be a Python file.

Create a `gunicorn_config.py` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```python
# gunicorn_config.py

bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"  # Address to bind Gunicorn to
workers = 3  # Number of worker processes
accesslog = "-"  # Log access to stdout (for easy debugging)
errorlog = "-"  # Log errors to stdout (for easy debugging)
loglevel = "info"  # Log level: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical"
timeout = 120  # Request timeout in seconds
```

Then, run Gunicorn with the config file:

```bash
gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py myproject.wsgi:application
```

### 5. **Configuring Gunicorn as a Systemd Service (for Automatic Start)**

If you're using an Ubuntu server or a system that supports `systemd`, it's a good practice to configure Gunicorn to run as a service that starts on boot. Here’s how you can do that:

1. **Create a Gunicorn Service File:**

   Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service` with the following content:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=gunicorn daemon for Django project
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=your_username
   Group=www-data
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
   ExecStart=/path/to/your/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/path/to/your/project.sock myproject.wsgi:application

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   - **`User`**: The user under which the service runs (replace `your_username` with your server’s user).
   - **`WorkingDirectory`**: The full path to your Django project.
   - **`ExecStart`**: The command to start Gunicorn (with full paths to the virtual environment and project).
   - **`/path/to/your/project.sock`**: This is a Unix socket file Gunicorn will use. Nginx can connect to it.

2. **Start and Enable the Gunicorn Service:**

   After creating the service file, reload systemd, start Gunicorn, and enable it to run at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start gunicorn
   sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
   ```

3. **Check the Status of the Service:**

   You can check whether Gunicorn is running correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status gunicorn
   ```

### 6. **Configuring Nginx to Work with Gunicorn**

Once Gunicorn is configured, you can set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle requests. Nginx will serve static files and forward requests to Gunicorn.

Here’s a basic Nginx configuration for serving a Django project:

1. **Install Nginx:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Create a Nginx Server Block:**

   Create a new configuration file for your site at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject`:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain_or_IP;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://unix:/path/to/your/project.sock;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }

       location /static/ {
           alias /path/to/your/project/static/;
       }

       location /media/ {
           alias /path/to/your/project/media/;
       }

       # Add SSL configuration if using HTTPS
   }
   ```

3. **Enable the Nginx Configuration:**

   Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   ```

4. **Test the Nginx Configuration:**

   Make sure there are no syntax errors in the configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

5. **Restart Nginx:**

   After confirming that the configuration is correct, restart Nginx to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### 7. **Final Steps:**
- Ensure you’ve collected static files (`python manage.py collectstatic`).
- Make sure your Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes your domain or IP address.
- Secure your site by configuring SSL certificates (e.g., with Let’s Encrypt).

Once these steps are completed, your Django app should be ready and running behind Nginx with Gunicorn!

## To check the GPU

```Python
import torch
import torchvision

print("Torch version:", torch.__version__)
print("Torchvision version:", torchvision.__version__)
print("CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
print("CUDA version:", torch.version.cuda)
```

### 📘 DateTime Difference Calculation

---

#### 🕒 Example Datetimes

```python
start_datetime = '2017-05-04 08:00:00'
end_datetime = '2017-05-04 09:30:00'
```

---

### 📐 Step 1: Convert Strings to `datetime` Objects

Use Python's `datetime.strptime()` to convert string to `datetime`.

```python
from datetime import datetime

start = datetime.strptime(start_datetime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
end = datetime.strptime(end_datetime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
```

---

### 🧮 Step 2: Calculate Time Difference

```python
difference = end - start
```

This returns a `timedelta` object.

---

### 📏 Step 3: Convert to Seconds, Minutes, Hours

#### 🧾 Total Seconds

```python
total_seconds = difference.total_seconds()
```

#### 🧾 Total Minutes

```python
total_minutes = total_seconds / 60
```

#### 🧾 Total Hours

```python
total_hours = total_seconds / 3600
```

---

### ✅ Final Output

For the above example:

```text
Seconds: 5400.0
Minutes: 90.0
Hours: 1.5
```

---

## To check port is running or not

#### ✅ On **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
```
Example:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :8000
```

Or:
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep :<port_number>
```

Or with `ss` (faster replacement for netstat):
```bash
ss -tuln | grep :<port_number>
```

#### ✅ On **Windows**:
```cmd
netstat -a -n | findstr :<port_number>
```

Example:
```cmd
netstat -a -n | findstr :8000
```
